Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

- `push(x)` -- Push element x onto stack.
- `pop() `-- Removes the element on top of the stack.
- `top()` -- Get the top element.
- `getMin()` -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

 
### Example 1:

**Input**
```
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]
```

**Output**
```
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]
```

**Explanation**
```
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
```
 

### Constraints:

- Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks.

### Approach

- Build data structure using a TypeScript Array
- `push(x)` - implement using built in array `.push()` method, which is constant time
- `pop()` - implement using built in array `.pop()` method, which is constant time
- `top()` - implement by reading the last element from the array, which is constant time
- `getMin()` - maintain a class attribte to track minimum values
  - Each time an element is pushed to the stack, add the minimum value to the min value array
  - Each time an element is popped, remove the last minimum value from the min value array
  - Get the minimum value by returning the last element from the min value array

### Runtime
All methods happen in constant time, as per requirements.

### Space
`O(N)` where `N` is the number of elements in the stack
    - The space complexity for the stack is `O(N)` plus `O(N)` for the space complexity on the min value stack
